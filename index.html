            <h2>Search Engine Optimization</h2>
            <p>The dominance of mobile internet use means that users are searching for the right business as they travel, 
                shop, or sit on their couch at home. Search Engine Optimization (SEO) allows 
                you to increase your visibility and find the right customers for your business.

            <h2>Online Reputation Management</h2>
            <p>
                The web is full of opinions, and some of these can be negative. Social media allows anyone with an 
                internet connection to say whatever they want about your business. Online Reputation Management gives you the control 
                over what potential customers see when they search for your business.

            <p>

                Social media marketing helps you determine which platforms are suited to your brand, 
                using analytics to find the right markets and increase your lead generation.
